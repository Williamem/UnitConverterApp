## styling
- ads
- home page grid
- icons
- header title and info icon, align. 
- fix the gradient in extra info box (categoryAlert)
- calendar icon looks a little off in date time input

## Logic
- how to dsiplay huge numbers (expand)
- set my units
- edit my units (pill?)
- when no units selected, select all
- x in input to remove all data

## Data
- time, decade century millenium, add info in description
- digital resolution can't be compared the way it is since some measure density. fix!
- cooking units are worng, should be caught in proofread, maybe add different for eu/us
- info about kibibyte https://www.logicmonitor.com/blog/what-the-hell-is-a-kibibyte
- (add one for dates (different calendars))

## copy
- better explanations and warnings
- proofread conversions
- remove abbreviations for comparative units

please proofread  for me, are the conversions correct, are they comparable, are the descriptions correct and appropriate? be conservative with asterisk and categoryAlert, it's usually more appropriate to put the information in description
